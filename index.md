I am a junior majoring in **Computer Engineering** at the [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/).

## Background

I have lived in the Bay Area of California my whole life, moving around from city to city as a kid. Currently, I live in *San Ramon*, a town located in the East Bay Area. I have two cats named **Pandu** and **Pinto**, as well as a brother who is six years younger than me. 

One of my favorite quotes, by Salvador Dali, is:

> Have no fear of perfection, you'll never reach it.

## Programming Interests

As a programmer, I thought it would be fitting for me to give a top-5 ranking of my favorite languages to program in: 

1. Java
2. Python
3. C/C++
4. JavaScript
5. Golang

Now, Python admittedly has easier syntax to process. If you want to print a simple message to the console: 

```
def print(name):
    print("Hello " + name)
```

Whereas in Java:
```
public void print(String name) {
    System.out.println("Hello " + name); 
}
```

However, I actually prefer Java more for this reason; I think having more stringent rules, such as specific method signatures, makes it easier for me to understand the code. 

Currently, I am working on becoming mroe familiar with JavaScript, and I have been working with a variety of JavaScript frameworks such as Node.js, React, and Angular. I am also teaching myself Go, which has been pretty fulfilling so far.

## Personal Interests

Some of the activities I enjoy doing in my free time are: 
 - Hiking / going on runs
 - Spectating basketball (and occasionally playing too)
 - Watching TV shows if I can find them on Netflix or Amazon Prime
 - Cooking food and experimenting with new recipes

As for what I wish to become involved in and accomplish in the future, here is a brief list of my aspirations:  
 - [ ] Learn how to surf, especially since I'm now in San Diego
 - [ ] Get better at playing the guitar 
 - [ ] Take a trip to Mexico 
 - [ ] Learn how to ride a motorcycle
